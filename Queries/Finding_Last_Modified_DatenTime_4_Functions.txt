Prob: Find the Last Modified date and time for Functions?

Sol:

* Check track commit is on or off using the following query

show track_commit_timestamp;

If it return "ON" go to step 3 else modify postgresql.conf
in Linux Environment
---------------------

cd /etc/postgresql/9.5/main/
vi postgresql.conf
Change

track_commit_timestamp = off
to

track_commit_timestamp = on


in Windows Environment:
--------------------
open postgresql.conf file

#track_commit_timestamp = off
change to
track_commit_timestamp = on

You don't have to reboot the system after modifiy the value, just restart the process. 
e.g. sudo service postgresql restart -- In Linux
or

In windows 
go to run --> services.msc --> select postgresql server --> click restart


select pg_xact_commit_timestamp(xmin) as last_alterd_datentime, * from pg_proc where proname ilike 'func_test';

Note: After changing track_commit_timestamp value to "on" only pg_xact_commit_timestamp funtion will work.
